Scripts for analysing the FBG data

The scripts here are used to analyse the data output from the Interrogator coupled to the FBG fibres. 
The output from the interrogator is a text file containing the date and time of measurement, the hardware information from the interrogator, the measurement parameters (integration time, sampling rate, noise threshold, sensitivity setting) and the wavelengths of the detected gratings.

Below this is the raw data from the fibres


The python scripts in this folderare intended to import the relevant data files and perform calculations to convert the detected wavelengths to strain or temperature values, depending on the fibre.
